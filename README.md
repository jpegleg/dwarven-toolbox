<b>Some of the included utilities do not ensure privacy, security, or quality. Use (hammeron|hammeroff|misc) for (educational|research) purposes unless you really know what you are doing.</b>

The hammer tools (hammeron and hammeroff) used directly on the CLI expose the key to the local system, like in history files and process lists.
If that is a concern, we can use them indirectly in some cases, moving the sensitive data to files, RAM, etc.
The hammer tools also can only take 127 bytes of data as input to encrypt at a time. Also, remeber to always use new IV and KEY since we are in CBC mode for hammeron!

(Use "rage" https://github.com/str4d/rage instead for more normal file encryption operations, or at least another tool designed for file encryption.)

The "dwarven-toolbox" technique with the hammers is to layer these tools together within scripts or other programs, although some of these tools are directly useful. The toolbox is not designed to work with files directly, however subshell concatenation aka "$(cat mything.txt)" can be used effectively in some cases.  The tools are designed for working with arguments passed into the programs. Combined with linux "xargs", we can pipe data into the utilities that way as well.


## Installation example

This script will compile all of the utilities and copy them to /usr/local/bin/ then clean up.

```
cargo build --release --all
for x in $(grep ^- README.md | grep -v 84 | cut -d'-' -f2); do
    echo "Installing $x"
    sudo cp target/release/$x /usr/local/bin/ 
done
cargo clean

```
As of version 1.1, the full collection of utilities compiled for x86 compiled for GNU/Linux is about 111MB. Each of those compiled utilities is currently ~4.1MB.

As of version 1.1, the full collection of utilities compiled for x86 compiled for Darwin (MacOS) is about 13MB. Each those compiled utilties is ~500KB.

## Usage 

We can compile each target: `cargo build --release all` and then install the resulting target/release/ binaries to /usr/local/bin/ 
and then use those within other programs as little utilities. Or compile just the ones we want to use: `cargo build --release --bin iron`, and then perhaps we'll simply copy it to our local bin: `sudo cp target/release/iron /usr/local/bin/`.


Example script leveraging the dwarven-toolbox programs:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

iv=$(anvil | grep IV | cut -d':' -f2)
key=$(anvil | grep KEY | cut -d':' -f2)
mercyv=$(anvil | grep IV | cut -d':' -f2)
mercyk=$(anvil | grep KEY | cut -d':' -f2)
echo $mercyv | xargs shielda | xargs armore | xargs magick
echo $mercyk | xargs shielda | xargs armore | rev | xargs magick

hammeron $mercyv "$iv $key" $mercyk
iron > code.txt
hammeron $iv "$(cat code.txt)" $key > code.txt.enc && cp /dev/null code.txt
```

The example puts a 32 byte string into a file named code.txt, which it then encrypts. In order to decrypt it, we'll need the iv and key that were used to encrypt it. The example takes the iv and key and encrypts those with yet another iv and key, which are then printed out with a few layers of encoding as a dash of obfuscation.
In order to decrypt, the secondary iv and key must hex decoded, the key reversed, both base64 decoded then base58 decoded, then those are used to decrypt the actual iv and key, which we then finally use to decrypt the code. This is just an example of some of the infinite possibilities of the dwarven-toolbox!

#### A more normal example

We might use `crown` to quickly generate checksums.

```
$ cat some_file.txt | xargs -0 crown | tee some_checksusms.txt
BLAKE3: 4fe765cc697336191276b8052bf510f9c511bcb024be05ac95bc58e7521963ab
BLAKE2B-512: 4984ef02e17c649c2131ab19af44094b6eaf8ef07445320bf017655071200af48f5d0b01d3cce37677f996d696705c09d0005db3f3c7100f6605f8559291631a

```

#### Hex magick!

The program `hexor` works well with `magick` and `antimagick` in this example:

```
$ hexor 65595411564354504511415e465443115e57115546504347545f115c5856594510 313131313131313131313131313131313131313131313131313131313131313131 | xargs antimagick
The great power of dwarven might!
```

We can combine XOR and bitshift in interesting ways with `swordleft`, `swordright`, `hexor`, `magick`, and `antimagick`.
We'll add in `gold` to generate a key which we'll XOR against, shift, and XOR again, for demonstration purposes.  Example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
   echo "Send in a single argument string!"
   exit 1
else
   echo "Permutation result:"
fi

inlen=${#1}

if [[ "$inlen" -gt 192 ]]; then
    echo "Input larger than 192 bytes, output truncated to 192 bytes!"
else
    :
fi

gold > gold.key

key=$(magick "$(cat gold.key)") 
plaintext=$(magick "$1")

r1=$(hexor "$plaintext" "$key")

rlength=${#r1}

iseven=$(( rlength / 2 ))

if [[ -z "$iseven" ]]; then
   :
else
   r1=0$r1
fi

r2=$(swordleft $r1)

r3=$(hexor "$r2" "$key")

echo $r3

```

Also note how we check to see if the hex is odd length before performing the bitshift. The hex output we use in dwarven-toolbox is raw, meaning that odd length values can occur. If we try to decode an odd length hex value, we'll get an error. The dwarven-toolbox utilties do not try to compensate for this, it is up to the higher level script or implementation to manage inputs in this way.

To reverse this example permutation, we would perform an XOR against the same key, shift right, then XOR that result against the key, and then hex decode.


#### Forensic and research power!

There are real situations when reverse engineering, researching, and performing ad-hoc operations where we may need to do some quick data butchery. The dwarven-toolbox is built to assist with such tasks. 

Malware might use only base58 encoding or XOR in a weak attempt to obscure information. With our toolbox at hand, we can quickly investigate numerous permutations, either directly or via scripts etc.

```
$ dshielda NZ1USWfjfFYuJ5wetRMLxtv6vjWn8p
Oh this was something!
```

#### Maths!

There are a number of basic math operations as individual utilities. The program `scale` takes any number of arguments and reports on several properties.

```
$ scale 234 3 23 43 
Average: 75.75000000
Mean: 75.75000000
Median: 33.00000000
Lowest value: 3.00000000
Highest value: 234.00000000
Range: 231.00000000
Sum of all values: 303.00000000
Softmax: [0.17487770452710943, 0.17487770452710943, 0.17487770452710943, 0.4753668864186717]
```

Note: `scale` currently can't take values greater than 709, larger values can result in a NaN during softmax normalization, which will result in a Panic.
Removing the softmax functionality will lift the max up to the 16 byte length. I've moved the softmax to the last computation so that the others will complete before a normalization panic. If we know we are going to use `scale` with numbers larger than 709, we can tuck away the softmax panic like so:

```
$ scale 1 2 3 999 3 33333333333333 3333333333333333 2>/dev/null
Average: 480952380952524.87500000
Mean: 480952380952524.87500000
Median: 3.00000000
Lowest value: 1.00000000
Highest value: 3333333333333333.00000000
Range: 3333333333333332.00000000
Sum of all values: 3366666666667674.00000000
```

The programs `axe`, `crossbow`, `stack`, `smash`, `catapult`, and `saw` each take two arguments.

<b>Warning: current with regular rust maths, after 16 digits, we'll start to get some funny behavior:</b>

```
11111111111111111111111111111.99999 + 1
11111111111111112000000000000
```

Because of this behavior, and not wanting/needing to pull in special handling for that, we have `smash`, `stack`, `scale` and `axe` are set to print an error message if an argument is long enough to trigger this behavior:

```
$ stack 11111111111111111111111111111.99999 1
Error: Argument longer than 16 bytes not supported!
```

Note that `saw`, `catapult`, and `crossbow` can handle the longer math arguments, however can still run into issues with some output larger than 18446744073709551615.

```
$ catapult 3243 33
72652289731892430000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
$
```
That should be 72652289731892424036412098202541310209361726602796135670284698733348436507686376801792853211158279959138140991212843! But at least it is the right length and starts correctly haha. This occurs when exponentiation using (`powf`) output exceeds f64 size aka 18446744073709551615 aka 2^64. 

Large numbers can be handled using additional crate if you feel the need to implement support for that! See https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/ for more information on that subject.

Here is an example script using some of them together:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

costs=$1
income=$2
account=$3

for months in {1..72}; do
    pay=$(stack $account $income)
    account=$(smash $pay $costs)
    account=$account
    echo "End of month $months total: $account"
done 
```

While regular BASH functionality could be used instead for this last example, and can be faster for some tasks, math in BASH has some odd behavior we may want to avoid.

```
$ x=$((11111111111111111111111111 + 1))
$ echo $x
-8480526731661512248
```
We could of course add handling for this type of thing in BASH, just as we are with the argument length property in the dwarven-toolbox. Even so, not having to deal with that is part of why some of these simple math utilties are included here.
