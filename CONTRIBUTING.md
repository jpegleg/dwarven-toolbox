Feel free to submit a PR! It may or may not get accepted, but go for it!

If you don't want to push changes back upstream to me and prefer to fork or reference, that is great too!

Issues opened in this github project have no SLA or guarantee of response at all, however myself or someone might respond eventually.

Dwarven-toolbox PRs that are more likely accepted:

- keep source code files clear and compact, with no or few comments
- include or improve tests
- optimize without ruining clarity
- provide bug fixes
- fix typos

Adding crates for improved handling (such as Anyhow) or fancier interfaces (such as Clap) are unlikely to be accepted in main, but I am open to the possibility.
